# Multiple Sequence Alignment ðŸ§¬
Course Project 1 for CS410

## Introduction
I have implemented 3 ways to solve MSA problems: DP, A*, and GA.  
DP and A* can find the optimal alignment while GA can find a sub-optimal one.


## Compile
This project is based on c++(without any additional library). It's simple for you to compile and run.

## Result
For 2d sequences, DP has the best performance.  
For 3d sequences, modified A* has the best performance.
